1. Install Matlab with the following toolboxes: 
    (i) Image Processing, 
    (ii) Image Accquisition, 
    (iii) Mapping.

2. Compiling the code from C to mex executable functions
    - All functions are store in VER15/FUNCTIONS folder
    - in Matlab, go the folder VER15, type mexfile

3. The main code controlling all the processes is Main_BPNM.m
    -This file is setup for an example in Bird Point New Madrid area. The lidar data is stored in "LiDAR_Data/BPNM/BPNM_DEM2.tif"
    - Modify this info in section "LOAD TOPOGRAPHIC DATA" to change the input lidar data for your study area.
    - After that, click Run arrow or type Main_BPNM to run the code.
    - The results are stored in RESULTS folder.
    - We need to write your own script to extract information from result file, depending on the purposes we want.    

4. Depending on the size and the number of large depressions on the landscape, the complete time can be very short or long due the loop search algorithm.
